#Eat Da Burger!


### Overview
* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat using Node, Express, Handlebars, MySQL, and ORM.

### Functionality

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a devoured button. When the user clicks it, the burger will be moved on a different spot on the page.

* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
